  - variations:
    - 2017v2: sum of weight by EventInfo bin(1), not 2, for scale/pdf/tune -> deprecated
    - 2017v3: merged jetcat
    - 2017v4: for PDF weight, rescale sum of weight with pdf0 / pdf_n (n<103) because pdf0 is nominal among sets! (but not one for mc prodiuction)

    - 2017v16: v14 + fix systematic for all category, same histo as v14!!
    - 2017v17: v16 + TH1::Smooth(5) for low stat samples (after symmetrization, before rebin)

    - 2017v28: v16 + V +- dV for up/dn sample all bins, (before symmetrization, before rebin)
    - 2017v29: v16 + [0.9,1.1] for low stat boundary
    - 2017v30: v16 + symm for jer b2j3 and cferr1 b4j4 (both 17 and 18)
